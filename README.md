# matty_et_al_2021
> Analysis package for the paper Matty et al. (2021).

This code was written and used to analyze tracks of midpoints of populations of *C. elegans* in a sensory integration assay. Most of this code is only useful for this particular set of experiments and will need to be adapted for other uses.


## Software

I used the following software for analysis and figure production:
- WormLab
- MATLAB 2021a
- Adobe Illustrator CC 2021


## File List

<b>Read `.abf` files in MATLAB</b>
- `abfload.m` : reads a `.abf` file (produced in pClamp) and produces a basic MATLAB structure
- `Loadabf.m` : wrapper for `abfload.m`; produces a more organized MATLAB struture for reading `.abf` files

<b>Analyze extracellular bursts in Spike2 and MATLAB</b>
- `batchImp.s2s` : given `.abf` files of type - ABF1(Integer) - which can be designated by exporting files in Clampfit, converts files to `.smr`, which is readable by other Spike2 scripts
- `spikenburst.s2s` : given a folder of `.smr` files, the gui walks you through defining bursts and spikes on extracellular traces using thresholding of membrane potential; produces `.txt` files for further anlaysis of spikes and bursts
- `readSpikeOutput.m` : given the `burst.txt` files produced by `spikenburst.s2s`, parces the data and produces simple measures of activity (e.g. frequency, spikes per burst, duration, duty cycle, start times, end times, and file numbers) for each burst
- `extracellularAnalysis.m` : for a particular experiment, this code uses `readSpikeOutput.m` and `convertpH.m` to pool and separate data into separate conditions; this function assumes that every condition was recorded in a separate `.abf` file; saves analysis as a structure `data.mat`

<b>Analyze intracellular waveforms in MATLAB</b>
- `analyzeWaveform.m` : given the waveform, sampling frequency, and default parameters, analyzes the slow wave and spiking activity of intracellular neurons
- `intracellularAnalysis.m` : for a particular experiment, this code uses `analyzeWaveform.m` to pool data for all conditions; this function assumes that every conditon was recorded in a separate `.abf` file; analyzes only the last minute of data; saves analysis as a structure `data.mat`

<b>Plotting data in MATLAB</b>
- `violinPlots.m` : given a 2D data matrix (columns are different conditions), creates violin plots; assumes 13 pH conditions, but code is simple and can be adapted for other purposes
- `violinPlotsControl.m` : similar to `violinPlots.m`, but assumes a 2D data matrix with columns as different preparations
- `stackedBarPlots.m` : produces stacked bar plots for state analysis
- `rectanglePlots.m` : produces colored boxes with saturation giving measure of rhythmicity
- `comparisonBarPlots.m` : produces colored boxes with saturation giving measure of rhythmicity for individual preparations at acid, base, and control

<b>Pool all experiments and plot in MATLAB</b>
- `pHCumulative.m` : accumulates all of the information from the `data.mat` files for each extracellular experiment included in the paper; produces all of the extracellular figures, saves data used in figures as `.csv` for statistics
- `pHCumulativePTX.m` : accumulates all of the information from the `data.mat` files for each intracellular PTX experiment included in the paper; produces all of the intracellular figures, saves data used in figures as `.csv` for statistics

<b>Statistical analyses in R/RStudio and MATLAB</b>
- `statistics.R`: code to compute a One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA with post-hoc Paired Samples T-Tests (Bonferonni-corrected) or a Two-Way Multivariate ANOVA with post-hoc Independent Samples T-Tests (Bonferonni-corrected); reads `.csv` files outputed from `pHCumulative.m` or `pHCumulativePTX.m` and saves statistical analyses as new `.csv` files
- `formatStatTables.m` : reformats the `.csv` files produced in R to be more legible for figures; requires some tweeking in Microsoft Excel before being saved as an Adobe PDF for further cosmetic changes in Adobe Illustrator; no substantive utility
