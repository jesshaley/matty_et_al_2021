# matty_et_al_2022
> Analysis package for the paper Matty et al. (2022).

This code was written and used to analyze tracks of midpoints of populations of *C. elegans* in a sensory integration assay. Most of this code is only useful for this particular set of experiments and will need to be adapted for other uses.


## Software

I used the following software for analysis and figure production:
- WormLab
- MATLAB 2021a
- Adobe Illustrator CC 2021
- GraphPad Prism


## File List

<b>Pool all experiments and plot in MATLAB</b>
- `trackingAnalysis.m` : accumulates all of the midpoints from WormLab and video files for each experiment included in Figure; produces all of the graphs for Figure 2 and Figure Supplement 3, saves data used in figures as `.xlsx` for statistics
